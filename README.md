####Foreword:

Taking inspiration from the furnace engine in Create, we decide that we could make something more realistic and cooler. The main philosophy of this mod is to provide more "realistic" power generation methods and machines & contraptions that will work to achieve this goal. This mod is also playable even in Creative Mode because it includes many decorative blocks such as metal cogwheels.

This mod requires Create and Flywheel as required dependencies. Immersive Engineering is an optional dependency that adds in steel for the mod.

####What we added:

Steam Engines of three types: Bronze, Cast Iron, and Steel
Flywheels of three types: Bronze, Cast Iron, and Steel
Cogwheels and Large Cogwheels of three types: Bronze, Cast Iron, and Steel
Steam: Designed with compatibility in mind! Other mods' steam fluids registered under forge:steam tag also works!
Burning Chambers of three types: Bronze, Cast Iron, and Steel
Steam Boilers of three types: Bronze, Cast Iron, and Steel

Fully configurable steam engine outputs, steam consumption, cogwheel stress impact, dynamo output and intake

####Upcoming Features:

Steam Encased Fan

Huge Cogwheels (say, 3x3 or 5x5 size)

Multiblock boilers & dynamos

Steam Ariship

Steam Jetpack

####Optional Feature:

Dynamo that produces FE from RPM. Redstone signal can be provided to lock it from working.

(Credits and appreciation to MRH0's energy conversion code)

As of 1.1.1, dynamo can be disabled in the server config.

CC&A is a great mod that I recommend you to use along Steam Powered. They provide a lot of good utilities for a modpack.

My only reason to add the dynamo to the mod is the fact that I want the people who only want the steam power part of create to run only with vanilla create and steam powered.
